## This is my digital portfolio for my Capstone Project

### What is this project?
When coming up with an idea for a project. Me and my partner wanted to do something that was actually useful to our lives. We had many ideas that might have been too ambitious but we settled on a fan project. We knew that we wanted the fan to have lights behind it in order to show cool designs while the fan is spinning. I was tasked with most of the work on making the fan while my partner worked on the electronics and the LED's. A successful project will be good looking all around and show cool light designs, all while actually cooling the area around it.

### Inspiration
My inspiration for the fan design was from a youtube video made by Fusion 360. I followed this video step-by-step in making my fan. However, as stated before, the fan did not work well because of the issues in printing. So I used the same model but gave it a couple tweeks to make it work. My blade has the same body but has more linear and boxy blades with slits to fit the blades into the body.

My project is different from this in multiple ways. First off, I use fan blades that are not curved.  This is to ensure that I can 3D print my fan very easily. I also have slits in my fan base to fit my fan blades into, this also helps with printing and makes the fan stronger in the long run.

### Design Specs
Here is the design specs document that I created:

### Materials List and Cost

### What tools will I use?
In this project, my partner and I want to incorporate many different tools. The main thing that we will use to create our fan and some of the parts of the base is the 3-d printer. This tool will allow us to design our parts exactly how we want them and is very precise, which is helpful. I use Fusion 360 for designing with the computers in the lab and the bamboo A1's to print my items. Additionally, we will be coding and using electronics and arduinos to control the movement of the fan and when it should spin. Lastly we will be using a bit of woodworking to make a good looking base for our project.

### Photos and Media

This is my original prototype of my fan. I used the inspiration youtube video to make this fan myself. The issue that I had was printing the fan. It was hard to print this with the slope of the fan blades and I could not get a good prototype. So I shifted to prototype 2.

This is my second prototype of my fan. I took my same disign of the first fan and changed the blades to be more linear and boxy. This made my fan way easier to print as opposed to what was happening before. Additionally, I also added slits in the body so that I could print the body and the blades seperatly, this also eased my printing process.

This is my most recent prototype of my fan. I have the body, the updated fan blades that fit into the body, and the attachment that allows me to spin the fan.

This is the first prototype of my fan. As you can see, the print is very difficult to make because the blades are so curved. This will make it harder to take off the supports and to make a good product. After seeing this, I new there needed to be change.

This is the final physical prototype of my fan that I have right now. As you can see it is more linear and square compared to my other fan and I added slits to help attach the blades. The item on the right is a connecting peice that will allow me to spin the fan by screwing it into the back of the base. While the attachment doesn't fit, I know the issue and will have it fixed soon.


### Important Decisions Being Made
As mentioned before, the most important decision that I have made is making my fan more boxy instead of curved. This idea helped me in so many ways and allowed me to continue the project. Another important decision was figuring out how we were going to make the fan spin. We solved this by adding the attachment that screws into the back of the fan and can spin the fan. More decisions are to come on fan size and the look of the base. 


### Daily Journal
Hi, this is my daily journal for my final engineering project.
9/16 - Today I started drawings for my final project. I drew a cone to collect rain water and a tube that contains sand and silt to filter out large sediment. I also drew them in a way to think about how I connect the two pieces together.


9/18 - Today I continued drawings for my project. I mainly worked on drawings for my water bottle. The hardest part was making the water fit with the filter. I decided to make it so the filter slides in the water bottle and has a long end to compensate for that.


9/19 - I started the day by making my daily journal on github. I then began research on my water filter but found that it would not be a safe project to do. I then spent the rest of class looking into other possible ideas for projects.


9/24 - Today I came up with the idea for a smart fan. I spent the rest of class looking through tutorials and ideas.


9/26 - Today we worked on soldering our owls. This exercise is to help us become better at soldering.


9/29 - Today I continued on my owl project. I finished with the resistors and the capacitors and started with the LEDs


9/30 - Today I finished with the LEDs and tested the owl, it did not work so I will need to test it again tomorrow.


10/1 - Today Jaden and I found tutorials for our fan project. I found a fusion tutorial that I really like and we drew out dimensions for the fan and its stand. I also made sure I had a fusion account and signed in.


10/6 - Today Jaden and I continued to plan for our project. We talked over how we are going to get the fan to spin and some of the dimensions. Jaden watched a tutorial on how to get the fan spinning and I started making the fan blade in Fusion 360 using a YouTube tutorial.


10/8 - Today I continued working on my fan design. I also troubleshooted my owl project.


10/9 - Today I did a practice 3-d print on a project that I made in freshmen engineering. It was good to learn the workflow for printing and how to use bamboo studio.


10/10 - Today I continued work on my fan blade design in fusion 360. I have made the body of the fan and one of the blades by following my tutorial, but had a lot of trouble rounding our the edges of the blade. I found a solution to my problem but have not yet had time to fix my design.


10/14 - Today we learned how to create a website that will house our portfolios for all of our projects. I had some issues with figuring out how to make my website show up with my personal information, but the issue was resolved and my website should be good to go.


10/16 - Today was a day to work on our digital portfolios and make sure we have everything done and submitted. I had no issues creating my docs with all of my projects and pictures.


10/21-10/24 - All of these days were spent relearning how to use Fusion 360 with a group of Kevin Kennedy's assigned by Mr.Dubick. I do not feel pretty comfortable using Fusion. We also had no class on 10/23


10/27 and 10/29 - These classes were used to learn how to use Makera Cam to design different things. I created a workflow on how to use the software and am very comfortable. We also used our designs to actually mill a product.


11/3-11/7 - This week was a mix of learning how to upload materials into github and to add links and photos to a github website page. When I was not doing that, I was working on testing printing from my fan. I need to make some adjustments and maybe print the parts separately.


11/11 - Today I worked on designing my fan in separate parts so that they can print easier.


11/12 - Today, we learned how to upload a topography map and 3D print it.


12/9 - Today we had a personal project day. I had issues because my fan file was backdated to before Thanksgiving, however, I was able to edit the file and make progress today, making holes for the fan and designing the blade. Tomorrow, I will print the test fan to make sure everything is looking good.


12/10 - Today I printed my prototype for my fan. I also worked on uploading files for my portfolio of this project and making sure my topography map was ready to go.


12/12 - Today I worked on my topo map and did not work on the fan.


12/15 - Today I printed the attachment that allows my fan to spin. It printed well but I need to shrink the radius just a tad and I also need to make sure the thread is the same on both the fan base and the attachment. I also troubleshooted my topography map project and worked on creating website pages for my final project and my topography map.


12/16 - Today I finally got to mill my topo map on the cnc machine. After I took care of that, I worked on documenting my final project and my topography map.


12/17 - Today, as homework, I worked on updating my github pages.
