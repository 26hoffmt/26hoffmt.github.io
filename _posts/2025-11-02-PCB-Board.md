Workflows: 

Making the PCB Board:
1. Open MakeraCAM and choose 3 or 4 axis(4 if object is rotating)
2. Select the dimensions and material that you need to use. Most likely will be using PCB
3. Download the three files from Mr.Dubick’s drive folder.
4. Open the three files in MakeraCAM
5. Once the three files are open, select the whole object so that the lines are dotted instead of solid.
6. Press M to move and set the settings to X: 6mm and Y: 6mm
7. Zoom in and deselect the top line using the shift key.
8. Click on the eyes of the Resistance1-PTH and the Resistance1-F_Cu_gbr_pad
9. Click on 2-d tools and select the 2-d pocket.
10. Make sure the end depth is .05mm
11. Go to the add tool and select 0.8 mm corn.
12. Add another tool, the 0.2mm 30 degree engraving(Metal).
13. Hit calculate, and make sure the pocket cut is in the sidebar.
14. Select just the .drl files and hide everything else.
15. Go up to 2-d tools and select drilling. Make the cutting depth 1.7mm
16. Add the corn tool again
17. Hide everything but resistance edge
18. Select 2-D tools and contour.
19. The tool is corn again and cut 1.7mm deep.
20. Scroll down and make the strategy outside.
21. Go to export, hit the three paths you made and select export.

Milling the Board:
1. Loosen the screws and remove the copper if there is one already in there.
2. Place your copper and tighten the screws 
3. Make sure your file is downloaded onto the computer
4. Go to Makeracam and upload and select your file
5. Home the machine
6. Make sure the fan is on
7. Make sure it is auto leveled
8. Make sure to preview to see if it looks right
9. Click run after preview 
10. Check for a red light
11. Once it starts going, you can leave it


Challenges: Making my PCB board and milling it was a new thing for me. My first issue was in the creation of the document. I was not very good at selecting the right lines for my 2-d pocket. Bu with enough practice attempts, I was able to see the lines I needed and select them. I also had trouble using the software to print. I messed up the dimensions on my design and did not know what steps to take and when to take the. However, I was able to learn and create good portfolios for this process. I also had some issues with the documentation precess and learning how to make a post. Using the help tab, I was able to figure out how to add images and I feel comfertable with making posts now. 

What I learned: One of the main goals of this project was to learn how to make a basic PCB board. These are very common and are used for many different things including housing and connectiong electrical compontents. To make the boards, we used the Makera Cam software and used 3 different templates from Mr. Dubick to create one big file. This gcode file is what was uploaded to the milling machines and milled into the final product that is shown above. 

When Making the design, one of the main things that I learned is how to upload and manipulate files in Makera Cam. In my opinion, the software is very similar to corel draw in the fact way that you selct lines and move files. We created different tools paths for different parts of the board. This is where I really learned how many different tools that there are and how persice you can get with your milling. I also refreshed myself with the idea of making workflows and using them. 

Laslty, we had to upload and mill our designs of a different computer. I refreshed my memory on uploading a file to the Fab Lab drive folder and I learned how to upload and mill files on makera cam. I made sure that the voltage, design, and settings were all correct and made a workflow for this process that is shown above. I also learned how to slide metal peices into the milling machine, and how to take them out. I learned how you need to be very precise with the dimensions of my metal and my folder.
