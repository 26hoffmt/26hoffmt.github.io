## This is my digital portfolio for my Final Project

### What is this project?
When coming up for an idea for a project. Me and my partner wanted to do something that was actually useful to our lives. We had mamy ideas that might have been to ambitious but we settled on a fan project. We knew that we wanted the fan to have lights behind it in order to show cool designs while the fan is spinning. I was tasked with most of the work on making the fan while my partner worked on the electronics and the LED's. A succesful project will be good looking all around and show col light designs, all while actually cooling the area areound it.

### Inspiration
My inspiration of the fan design was from a youtube video made by funsion 360. I followed this video step-by-step in making my fan. However, as stated before, the fan did not work well because of the issues in printing. So I used the same model but gave it a couple tweeks to make it work. My blade has the same body but has more linear and boxy blades with slits to fit the blades into the body. 
Here is the Youtube video: 

### Design Specs

This is my original prototype of my fan. I used the inspiration youtube video to make this fan myself. The issue that I had was printing the fan. It was hard to print this with the slope of the fan blades and I could not get a good prototype. So I shifted to prototype 2.

This is my second prototype of my fan. I took my same disign of the first fan and changed the blades to be more linear and boxy. This made my fan way easier to print as opposed to what was happening before. Additionally, I also added slits in the body so that I could print the body and the blades seperatly, this also eased my printing process.
