## This is my digital portfolio for my Final Project

### What is this project?
When coming up for an idea for a project. Me and my partner wanted to do something that was actually useful to our lives. We had mamy ideas that might have been to ambitious but we settled on a fan project.

This is my original prototype of my fan. I used the inspiration youtube video to make this fan myself. The issue that I had was printing the fan. It was hard to print this with the slope of the fan blades and I could not get a good prototype. So I shifted to prototype 2.

This is my second prototype of my fan. I took my same disign of the first fan and changed the blades to be more linear and boxy. This made my fan way easier to print as opposed to what was happening before. Additionally, I also added slits in the body so that I could print the body and the blades seperatly, this also eased my printing process.
