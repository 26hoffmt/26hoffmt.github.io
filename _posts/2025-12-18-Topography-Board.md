## This is my digital portfolio for my Topography Map

### Photos and Media

This is a picture of my Topo aspire design. I took the stl file of Lake Tahoe and turned it into a cnc file that could be milled.


### Challenges and how I overcame them

This project was very difficult due to the fact that it was a very new concept to me. I had not used a cnc machine in a couple years and had never used aspire before, so making this project was a learning moment and a challenge.
