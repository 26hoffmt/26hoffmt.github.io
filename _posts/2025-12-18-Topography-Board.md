## This is my digital portfolio for my Topography Map

### Photos and Media

This is a picture of my Topo aspire design. I took the stl file of Lake Tahoe and turned it into a cnc file that could be milled.


### Challenges and how I overcame them

This project was very difficult due to the fact that it was a very new concept to me. I had not used a cnc machine in a couple years and had never used aspire before, so making this project was a learning moment and a challenge. When I figured out how to make my map using aspire I milled it, but it didn't work and the mill kept going above the wood. Me and Mr.D figured out the issue and switched the setting so that my map worked correctly.



### What I learned

This project was to make a 3.5x2.5 inch topography map of a mountain range. While this project was a cool way to make a gift or something cool to look at, it also helped me learn a new disgin software and hwo to use the cnc machine. While I don't anticipate using this machine for my personal project, I am glad that I have the skills to use it if needed. If I could go back again, I would not only choose my own topography area instead of the base Lake Tahoe that Mr.D provided, but I would also look more into aspire and cnc milling to see wht skills I would need beforehand.
