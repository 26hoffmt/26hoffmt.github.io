## This is my digital portfolio for my Topography Map

This is a picture of my Topo aspire design. I took the stl file of Lake Tahoe and turned it into a cnc file that could be milled.

This is the final product of my topography map. I had to find an irregular peice of wood to use because there were not regular pieces left. Nevertheless, the final product came out great.

### Challenges and how I overcame them

This project was very difficult due to the fact that it was a very new concept to me. I had not used a cnc machine in a couple years and had never used aspire before, so making this project was a learning moment and a challenge. When I figured out how to make my map using aspire I milled it, but it didn't work and the mill kept trying to mill the air above the wood. Me and Mr.D figured out the issue and switched the setting in my aspire file so that my map worked correctly.



### What I learned

This project was to make a 3.5x2.5 inch topography map of a mountain range. While this project was a cool way to make a gift or something cool to look at, it also helped me learn a new disgin software and hwo to use the cnc machine. While I don't anticipate using this machine for my personal project, I am glad that I have the skills to use it if needed. If I could go back again, I would not only choose my own topography area instead of the base Lake Tahoe that Mr.D provided, but I would also look more into aspire and cnc milling to see wht skills I would need beforehand.


### Workflow

#### Making the PCB Board

1. Open MakeraCAM and choose 3 or 4 axis(4 if object is rotating)

  
2. Select the dimensions and material that you need to use. Most likely will be using PCB

   
3. Download the three files from Mr.Dubick’s drive folder.


4. Open the three files in MakeraCAM


5. Once the three files are open, select the whole object so that the lines are dotted instead of solid.


6. Press M to move and set the settings to X: 6mm and Y: 6mm


7. Zoom in and deselect the top line using the shift key.


8. Click on the eyes of the Resistance1-PTH and the Resistance1-F_Cu_gbr_pad


9. Click on 2-d tools and select the 2-d pocket.


10. Make sure the end depth is .05mm


11. Go to the add tool and select 0.8 mm corn.


12. Add another tool, the 0.2mm 30 degree engraving(Metal).


13. Hit calculate, and make sure the pocket cut is in the sidebar.


14. Select just the .drl files and hide everything else.


15. Go up to 2-d tools and select drilling. Make the cutting depth 1.7mm


16. Add the corn tool again


17. Hide everything but resistance edge


18. Select 2-D tools and contour.


19. The tool is corn again and cut 1.7mm deep.


20. Scroll down and make the strategy outside.


21. Go to export, hit the three paths you made and select export.


#### Milling the Board

1. Loosen the screws and remove the wood if there is one already in there.


2. Place your wood and tighten the screws 


3. Make sure your file is downloaded onto the computer


4. Go to Makeracam and upload and select your file


5. Make sure the dimensions of the block is right


6. Home the machine


7. Make sure the fan is on

8. Make sure it is auto leveled


9. Make sure to preview to see if it looks right


10. Click run after preview 

11. Check for a red light

12. Once it starts going, you can leave it
